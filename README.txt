This script runs the apt-get update, apt-get upgrade and, apt-get autoremove
commands in the linux shell.

By typing: "sudo su" in your terminal

How to use:

	- Save the script somewhere you can find it easily;
	- Open the Terminal and cd into the folder you saved the script in;

	- Type: ls, in the terminal to make sure the script is executable;
		IF NOT use: chmod +x updater.py to make it executable.

	  update your system.

---------------------------------

This is my first ever Python script, at the moment I am trying to add a sudo
check to the script. If you got any hints/tips or inquiries, please
let me know.
